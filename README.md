Concept designs in Sketchup for Langstroth hive components; specifically for a 10-frame setup.
Designs include

- Screened bottom board

  - screened bottom
  - removable mite board as a form of Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
  - 2 x 4 construction for durability
  - 1/8" lip that fits inner dimensions of hive boxes for increased traction during movement
  - sloped landing strip to remove moisture build-up from rain
  - 5/8" entrance clearance to allow access for front-usage vaporizer
  - side walls include 3/4" holes that mimic [ApiShield's hornet trap](http://www.vita-europe.com/products/apishield-hornet-trap/):

  - Lightweight mesh bottom to allow for ventilation
  - Swivel gate for variable exterior ventilation
  - 3" high walls for housing moisture absorbing content (like newspaper, egg cartons, etc.)

- Medium-to-deep extension

  - Extends the regular medium (or dadant) box by 3" to match the height of a deep box
  - Recessed cuts at the bottom extend into frame rests of medium box below, making a tight/secure fit
  
- Gabled outer cover
